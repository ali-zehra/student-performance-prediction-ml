# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts student academic performance based on demographic and academic features using machine learning techniques.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Dataset
Student Performance Dataset from kaggle

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prithipal2873/student-performance-prediction
## Approach
- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model training using regression models
- Model evaluation

## Model Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

## Results
Linear Regression performed poorly due to non-linear relationships.
Random Forest significantly reduced prediction error and improved performance.

## Conclusion
The model provides insights into factors affecting student performance and demonstrates the application of machine learning in educational data analysis.
